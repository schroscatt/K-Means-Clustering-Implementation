# K-Means-Clustering-Implementation

My code file includes K-Means Clustering Algorithm from scratch. 

You can also find methods for choosing the best K value (Elbow Method & Silhoutte Method)


Main functions for K-means:
   - **randomlyAssign,** 
   - **calculateObjective,**
   - **findClusterCentroids,**
   - **assignToCentroid**
